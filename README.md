# Modern Template Techniques

Here i explore the use of advanced template techniques, including class template argument deduction, smart pointers, structs, classes, abstract classes, virtual functions, `auto`, `lambda`, and `constexpr`.

The goal of this repository is for me to learn about modern template techniques.

## Contents

The repo contains various examples that illustrate different advanced template techniques and their use cases. Each example is well commented and easy to understand.

### Class Template Argument Deduction

class template argument deduction feature to deduce template arguments from constructor parameters.

### Smart Pointers

Smart pointers to manage the lifetime of objects in class templates and structs.

### Structs and Classes

Structs and classes in template programming being used together.

### Abstract Classes and Virtual Functions

Combination of abstract classes and virtual functions in template programming.

### Auto and Lambda

`auto` and lambda can be used in conjunction with templates to make code more concise and expressive.

### Constexpr

`constexpr` to make template code more efficient at runtime and during compile-time.

## How to Use

The examples in this repository are personal reference, with each example covering a specific concept.

basic understanding of template programming in C++ before diving into the example.
